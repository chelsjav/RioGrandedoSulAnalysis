## Key Findings
Income distribution is highly skewed, with some municipalities earning significantly more than others. Higher-income
municipalities tend to be urban centers, while rural areas exhibit lower wages. Correlation analysis suggests that
municipalities with high mean income also have high median income, but there is a variation due to inequality. Geospatial
analysis confirms regional disparities, emphasizing urban-rural income gaps. Data quality issues include missing values
and high variance, requiring careful statistical treatment.
